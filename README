Business-UTV version 0.01
=========================

This module provides access to UTV Internet account information.
Specifically it enables you to programmatically retrieve
your current monthly download/upload usage and call details 
from your monthly phone bill.

A gnome2 tray icon is provided that allows you to monitor
you monthly usage without going to the UTV website.

By definition I have only tested this module against my own account.
I will endeavour to support other account configurations where possible.
